#### Create a simple command-line number guessing game in Node.js. Ensure all the code is contained within the file specified.  

I'll create a simple number guessing game in Node.js. The game will:
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100
2. Ask the user to guess the number
3. Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low
4. Count the number of attempts
5. End when the user guesses correctly

Here's the implementation:

testing/simple_game.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
const readline = require('readline');

// Create interface for reading from stdin and writing to stdout
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

// Generate a random number between 1 and 100
const secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
let attempts = 0;

console.log('Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!');
console.log('I\'m thinking of a number between 1 and 100.');

function askGuess() {
  rl.question('What is your guess? ', (answer) => {
    // Convert the answer to a number
    const guess = parseInt(answer, 10);
    attempts++;

    // Check if the input is a valid number
    if (isNaN(guess)) {
      console.log('Please enter a valid number!');
      askGuess();
      return;
    }

    // Compare the guess with the secret number
    if (guess < secretNumber) {
      console.log('Too low! Try again.');
      askGuess();
    } else if (guess > secretNumber) {
      console.log('Too high! Try again.');
      askGuess();
    } else {
      console.log(`Congratulations! You guessed the number ${secretNumber} in ${attempts} attempts!`);
      rl.close();
    }
  });
}

// Start the game
askGuess();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You can run the game with:

```bash
node testing/simple_game.js
```
