**MCP Server Debugging Log (Conceptual `progress.md`/`activeContext.md` Update)**

**Goal:** Get the `aider-and-experts` MCP server fully operational, including file modification capabilities.

**Progress:**

1.  **Initial State:** MCP server failed to start (`Client closed`, TDZ error `Cannot access 'fs_1'`).
2.  **Fix Applied:** Resolved TDZ error by moving initial `log()` calls from top-level scope into the `main()` function in `src/index.ts`.
3.  **Build & Restart:** Successfully rebuilt the project (`npm run build`). Configured MCP (`mcp.json`) to run `node dist/index.js`.
4.  **Server Operational:** MCP server now starts correctly and tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) are callable. The server successfully spawns the `aider` process.
5.  **File Modification Tested:**
    *   Direct terminal execution of `aider` commands *successfully* modified test files.
    *   Execution of the *same* `aider` commands via the MCP server tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) did *not* modify files, despite the `aider` process exiting successfully (code 0).
    *   Attempted adding `{ shell: true }` to the `spawn` call in `src/index.ts`; this did not resolve the file modification issue.
6.  **Bundling Attempt:** Replaced `tsc` build with `esbuild` to bundle `src/index.ts` into `dist/index.js` based on forum suggestions for "Client closed" errors.
7.  **MCP Launch Still Fails:** Reloading MCP client still results in "Client closed" error, even though `node dist/index.js` runs successfully manually.
8.  **Diagnostic Log Added:** Added `console.error("--- MCP SCRIPT START ---")` at the top of `src/index.ts` (after shebang).


**Current Status:**

*   The `aider-and-experts` MCP server (`dist/index.js`) runs when executed manually.
*   **Blocker:** MCP server **still fails to launch** correctly via Cursor ("Client closed"), even after bundling.
*   Awaiting results from diagnostic log check.
*   Documentation updated: LICENSE, QR code, and critical rules file downloaded; README.md formatting verified.

**Needs / Next Steps:**

1.  **Verify Script Start:** User to run `npm run build`, reload MCP client, and check Cursor logs for `"--- MCP SCRIPT START ---"` message.
2.  **If Log Appears:** Debug the script execution *after* the start message.
3.  **If Log Doesn't Appear:** Investigate Cursor's MCP launch mechanism further (possible environment, stdio, or process management issue).
4.  **(Pending) Debug `aider` File Modification:** Address the original issue once the server launches reliably via MCP.
5.  **Memory Bank Files:** Draft initial versions of missing Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) with summaries of project vision, context, patterns, and technology.

- **Date:** 2025-04-28
- **Status:** BLOCKED
- **Task:** Utilize `prompt_aider` and `double_compute` tools (@nbiish/ai-tool-mcp) for expert `aider` prompt generation.
- **Blocker:** MCP connection error for `@nbiish/giizhendam-aabajichiganan-mcp` (Error -32000: Connection closed).
- **Next Step:** Diagnose MCP connection issue.

- **Date:** 2025-04-28
- **Status:** FIX APPLIED (PENDING VERIFICATION)
- **Task:** Fix MCP connection for `prompt_aider` and `double_compute` tools.
- **Issue Identified:** Missing shebang line in bundled output causing npx execution failure.
- **Solution:** Modified build script in package.json to add proper shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) using esbuild's banner option.
- **Next Step:** Rebuild package with `npm run build` and test with Cursor MCP.
