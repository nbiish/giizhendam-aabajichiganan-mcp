**MCP Server Debugging Log (Conceptual `progress.md`/`activeContext.md` Update)**

**Goal:** Get the `aider-and-experts` MCP server fully operational, including file modification capabilities.

**Progress:**

1.  **Initial State:** MCP server failed to start (`Client closed`, TDZ error `Cannot access 'fs_1'`).
2.  **Fix Applied:** Resolved TDZ error by moving initial `log()` calls from top-level scope into the `main()` function in `src/index.ts`.
3.  **Build & Restart:** Successfully rebuilt the project (`npm run build`). Configured MCP (`mcp.json`) to run `node dist/index.js`.
4.  **Server Operational:** MCP server now starts correctly and tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) are callable. The server successfully spawns the `aider` process.
5.  **File Modification Tested:**
    *   Direct terminal execution of `aider` commands *successfully* modified test files.
    *   Execution of the *same* `aider` commands via the MCP server tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) did *not* modify files, despite the `aider` process exiting successfully (code 0).
    *   Attempted adding `{ shell: true }` to the `spawn` call in `src/index.ts`; this did not resolve the file modification issue.
6.  **Bundling Attempt:** Replaced `tsc` build with `esbuild` to bundle `src/index.ts` into `dist/index.js` based on forum suggestions for "Client closed" errors.
7.  **MCP Launch Still Fails:** Reloading MCP client still results in "Client closed" error, even though `node dist/index.js` runs successfully manually.
8.  **Diagnostic Log Added:** Added `console.error("--- MCP SCRIPT START ---")` at the top of `src/index.ts` (after shebang).


**Current Status:**

*   The `aider-and-experts` MCP server launches and the tools are callable.
*   **Recent Changes:** Added proper non-interactive mode flags (`--yes` and `--no-pretty`) to help aider work better in programmatic environments.
*   **Next Test:** Need to verify if these changes resolve the file modification issues.
*   Documentation updated: activeContext.md and progress.md reflect current improvements.

**Needs / Next Steps:**

1.  **Test MCP Server:** Test the `prompt_aider` tool with the updated package to see if our changes fixed the issue.
2.  **Verify File Modifications:** Check if aider can now successfully modify files when called through the MCP server.
3.  **If Error Persists:** Consider more radical approaches, such as using the `--message` flag for a fully scripted interaction.
4.  **Memory Bank Files:** Continue updating Memory Bank files with the latest progress and findings.

- **Date:** 2025-04-28
- **Status:** BLOCKED
- **Task:** Utilize `prompt_aider` and `double_compute` tools (@nbiish/ai-tool-mcp) for expert `aider` prompt generation.
- **Blocker:** MCP connection error for `@nbiish/giizhendam-aabajichiganan-mcp` (Error -32000: Connection closed).
- **Next Step:** Diagnose MCP connection issue.

---

- **Date:** 2025-04-28
- **Status:** FIX APPLIED (PENDING VERIFICATION)
- **Task:** Fix MCP connection for `prompt_aider` and `double_compute` tools.
- **Issue Identified:** Missing shebang line in bundled output causing npx execution failure.
- **Solution:** Modified build script in package.json to add proper shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) using esbuild's banner option.
- **Next Step:** Rebuild package with `npm run build` and test with Cursor MCP.

---

- **Date:** 2025-04-28
- **Status:** PROGRESS (NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED)
- **Task:** Debug aider execution via MCP server tools.
- **Issue Identified:** "Input is not a terminal (fd=0)" error when running aider through MCP.
- **Solution Attempted:** Modified stdio configuration from `['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` to `['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` and tried adding flags `--no-input` and `--noninteractive`.
- **Result:** MCP server still showing errors about unrecognized arguments despite removing flags from source and rebuilding.
- **Next Step:** Restart Cursor/MCP server to pick up the new code, then test again.

---

- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Status:** IMPROVED (PENDING VERIFICATION)
- **Task:** Enhance aider non-interactive support in MCP server tools.
- **Issue Addressed:** "Input is not a terminal (fd=0)" error affecting aider's ability to modify files.
- **Solution Applied:** Added appropriate flags for non-interactive execution: `--yes` to automatically accept confirmations and `--no-pretty` to disable terminal formatting.
- **Package Update:** Published version 0.3.37 with these improvements.
- **Next Step:** Test the updated package to verify if file modifications now work correctly.
