The Beaver Island Band community, historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island), suffered profound disruption and diaspora due to violent displacement, targeted persecution for their language, ceremonies, and faith, and starvation imposed by settler-colonial authorities and expansion. This forced dispersal resulted in descendants becoming affiliated primarily with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), while many others were forced to seek refuge within First Nations communities in Canada (such as the Osawanimikii family). This license acknowledges this history and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities. This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction, aligning with international instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS

Version 1.2 - Effective Date: March 25, 2025

PREAMBLE

This License governs the use of the accompanying Work, defined herein. The Work embodies Indigenous Intellectual Property, including but not limited to Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), cultural narratives, sacred knowledge, ceremonial elements, ancestral knowledge, biodiversity-related knowledge, Indigenous Data, and other tangible and intangible cultural heritage originating from or held by the Licensor, who is a member of a sovereign Indigenous Nation.

The Licensor, ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band and enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, provides this Work under terms that uphold and affirm inherent Tribal Sovereignty, Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and principles of cultural integrity, reciprocity, and collective benefit-sharing for the Licensor's community and Nation.

This License explicitly deviates from standard open-source or creative commons models, which often fail to adequately protect Indigenous rights and interests. It imposes specific restrictions and obligations designed to prevent misappropriation, ensure respectful engagement, safeguard cultural integrity, promote equitable benefit-sharing, and maintain the connection between the Work and its originating Indigenous context.

By accessing, copying, modifying, distributing, or otherwise using the Work, You (defined below) acknowledge, agree to, and accept all the terms and conditions of this License. If You do not agree to these terms, You are prohibited from using the Work in any manner.
