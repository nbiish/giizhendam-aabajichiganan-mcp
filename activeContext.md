**MCP Server Debugging Log (Conceptual `progress.md`/`activeContext.md` Update)**

**Goal:** Get the `aider-and-experts` MCP server fully operational, including file modification capabilities.

**Progress:**

1.  **Initial State:** MCP server failed to start (`Client closed`, TDZ error `Cannot access 'fs_1'`).
2.  **Fix Applied:** Resolved TDZ error by moving initial `log()` calls from top-level scope into the `main()` function in `src/index.ts`.
3.  **Build & Restart:** Successfully rebuilt the project (`npm run build`). Configured MCP (`mcp.json`) to run `node dist/index.js`.
4.  **Server Operational:** MCP server now starts correctly and tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) are callable. The server successfully spawns the `aider` process.
5.  **File Modification Tested:**
    *   Direct terminal execution of `aider` commands *successfully* modified test files.
    *   Execution of the *same* `aider` commands via the MCP server tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) did *not* modify files, despite the `aider` process exiting successfully (code 0).
    *   Attempted adding `{ shell: true }` to the `spawn` call in `src/index.ts`; this did not resolve the file modification issue.
6.  **Bundling Attempt:** Replaced `tsc` build with `esbuild` to bundle `src/index.ts` into `dist/index.js` based on forum suggestions for "Client closed" errors.
7.  **MCP Launch Still Fails:** Reloading MCP client still results in "Client closed" error, even though `node dist/index.js` runs successfully manually.
8.  **Diagnostic Log Added:** Added `console.error("--- MCP SCRIPT START ---")` at the top of `src/index.ts` (after shebang).
9.  **Terminal Error Fix:** Identified "Input is not a terminal (fd=0)" error when running aider through MCP. Modified stdio configuration from `['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` to `['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']`.
10. **Invalid Flags Removed:** Attempted adding flags `--no-input` and `--noninteractive` to help with non-interactive mode, but found these aren't supported by aider. Removed these flags.


**Current Status:**

*   The `aider-and-experts` MCP server launches and the tools are callable.
*   **Blocker:** Tools still fail with the error: "aider: error: unrecognized arguments: --no-input --noninteractive" despite removing these flags from the source code and rebuilding.
*   Hypothesis: The MCP server is not picking up the updated code from the build process and needs to be restarted.
*   Documentation updated: activeContext.md and progress.md reflect current troubleshooting efforts.

**Needs / Next Steps:**

1.  **Restart MCP Server:** User needs to restart the MCP server (Cursor) to pick up the latest built code.
2.  **Re-test Tools:** After restarting, test the `prompt_aider` tool again to see if our changes fixed the issue.
3.  **If Error Persists:** Verify build process, check for other occurrences of the flags, and consider alternative approaches.
4.  **Debug File Modification:** Once tools execute without error, address the original issue of file modification not working.
5.  **Memory Bank Files:** Continue updating Memory Bank files with the latest progress and findings.

## Current Blocker: MCP Still Using Old Code (2025-04-28)

- **Issue:** Despite removing invalid flags from source and rebuilding, the MCP server is still showing errors about unrecognized arguments: `--no-input` and `--noninteractive`.
- **Impact:** The `prompt_aider` and `double_compute` tools still fail to execute properly.
- **Fix Applied:** Changed stdio configuration to `['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` and removed invalid flags from the source code.
- **Next Step:** Restart Cursor/MCP server to pick up the new code, then test the tools again.
