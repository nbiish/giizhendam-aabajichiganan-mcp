**Current Task:** Verifying the fix for the `aider`-based tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) failing to perform file system operations when invoked via the MCP server.

**Recent Key Changes/Decisions:**
*   Identified that `aider` v0.82.2 does not support the `--edit-model` flag, causing errors when `AIDER_EDITOR_MODEL` was set.
*   Removed `AIDER_EDITOR_MODEL` from the `~/.cursor/mcp.json` configuration for this server.
*   Identified that `aider` (via MCP) *still* failed file operations even without the flag error.
*   Modified `src/index.ts` (`executeAider` function):
    *   Removed `--edit-model` flag handling.
    *   Added explicit CWD logging before spawning `aider`.
    *   Added explicit `cwd: process.cwd()` to the `spawn` options for `aider`.
*   Incremented package version to `0.3.22`.
*   Successfully published `@nbiish/giizhendam-aabajichiganan-mcp@0.3.22` to npm.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1.  **Test `prompt_aider`:** Run the `prompt_aider` tool via the MCP server (using the newly published v0.3.22 via `npx`) to create a test file (e.g., `test-dir/test_verify.txt`).
2.  **Verify File Creation:** Use `list_dir` or terminal commands to confirm the test file was created successfully.
3.  If successful, proceed to test `double_compute` similarly.
4.  If still failing, analyze the logs (including the new CWD log) from `/tmp/giizhendam_mcp_v2_log.txt` and potentially add more specific debugging around the `spawn` call in `src/index.ts`.

**Active Considerations:**
*   Ensuring the environment (`PATH`, permissions) for the `npx`-spawned MCP server process allows `aider` to function correctly.
*   Confirming the `dual-publish` rule implications (versioning for `@nbiish/ai-tool-mcp`).
*   Need for automated testing infrastructure.
