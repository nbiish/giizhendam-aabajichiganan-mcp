# Active Context (As of: [Get Current Date/Time])

**Current Task:** Debugging persistent `aider` file system operation failures when invoked via MCP server.

**Recent Key Changes/Decisions:**
*   Identified that `aider` v0.82.2 does not support the `--edit-model` flag. (Removed from `mcp.json`).
*   Attempted fix 1: Added explicit `cwd: process.cwd()` to `spawn` options in `src/index.ts`. (v0.3.22) - **Failed Verification.**
*   Attempted fix 2: Modified `src/index.ts` to resolve file paths to absolute paths before passing to `aider`. (v0.3.24) - **Failed Verification.**
*   Checked permissions for target directory (`test-dir`) - confirmed owner (`nbiish`) has write permissions (`rwx`). **Permissions ruled out as cause.**

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1.  **Investigate Aider Internals/Environment:** Explore if `aider` has verbose/debug flags or if the environment (`PATH`, etc.) within the spawned process differs significantly from a direct terminal execution.
2.  **Consider Simplified Spawn Test:** Potentially create a minimal Node.js script outside MCP to isolate the `aider` spawn behavior.
3.  Re-examine server logs (`/tmp/giizhendam_mcp_v2_log.txt`) for subtle clues missed previously.

**Active Considerations:**
*   Potential differences in environment variables or PATH between interactive shell and `npx`-spawned process.
*   Internal behavior of `aider` regarding file operations when run non-interactively via `spawn`.
*   Need for automated testing infrastructure.
