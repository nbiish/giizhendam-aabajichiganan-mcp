# Project Progress

**Current Version:** 0.3.22 (as of 2025-04-28)

**Completed Features/Components:**
*   Initial implementation of MCP server (`src/index.ts`).
*   Tool: `prompt_aider` (v1 implementation).
*   Tool: `double_compute` (v1 implementation).
*   Tool: `finance_experts` (using Gemini API, saves to output dir).
*   Tool: `ceo_and_board` (using Gemini API, saves to output dir).
*   Basic Zod validation for tool parameters.
*   Configuration via environment variables (`mcp.json`).
*   Basic logging to `/tmp/giizhendam_mcp_v2_log.txt`.
*   Build process using `tsc`.
*   Publishing setup via `npm`.

**Work In Progress:**
*   Fixing file system interaction issues with `prompt_aider` / `double_compute`.

**Known Issues/Bugs:**
*   **Resolved (v0.3.22):** `aider` tools failed due to incompatible `--edit-model` flag being passed when `AIDER_EDITOR_MODEL` env var was set.
*   **Under Investigation (v0.3.22):** `aider` tools fail file system operations (creation/modification) when invoked via the MCP server, even when the command runs successfully manually and returns exit code 0. Attempted fix by setting explicit `cwd` in `spawn` call.

**Evolution of Major Decisions:**
*   Initial approach might have involved a shell script wrapper; moved to direct `spawn` of `aider` for better control and error handling.
*   Shifted from hardcoded defaults to reliance on environment variables for models and API keys.
*   Refined error handling to use `safeErrorReport` for client responses.
*   Added explicit CWD setting during `spawn` to troubleshoot file system issues.

**Overall Status:**
*   Core functionality for all four tools is implemented.
*   Simulation tools (`finance_experts`, `ceo_and_board`) appear functional based on initial tests.
*   `aider`-based tools (`prompt_aider`, `double_compute`) are blocked by a persistent file system interaction issue when run via the MCP server. A potential fix has been implemented and published (v0.3.22), awaiting verification.
