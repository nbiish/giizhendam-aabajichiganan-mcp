publish to:
- 'giizhendam-aabajichiganan-mcp' -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nbiish/giizhendam-aabajichiganan-mcp
- 'ai-tool-mcp' -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nbiish/ai-tool-mcp
- Increment both package versions slightly when calling this to build/publish/etc..


# ALWAYS RUN THROUGH (in this order):
- [critical.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/critical.mdc)
- update [README.md](mdc:README.md) (changes, etc)
- commit all changes before proceeding
- [dual-publish.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dual-publish.mdc) <-(runs 'npm run build')
- make an appropriate @.gitignore that does not interfere with pair programmers
- we use npx in our [mcp.json](mdc:Users/nbiish/.cursor/mcp.json) to install, test, and use our codebase's mcp server
