**1. Opening Remarks (Sarah Miller)**

Chair Miller:  Good morning, everyone. Let's begin our discussion on the recent Q3 test results. David, could you give us a brief overview?

**2. CEO Overview (David Chen)**

CEO Chen:  Thanks, Sarah. Q3 testing showed mixed results. We exceeded projections in User Acceptance Testing (UAT) but experienced some delays in System Integration Testing (SIT). Maria can provide specifics on the technical aspects.  Overall, we remain on track for the Q4 launch, albeit with slightly adjusted timelines.

**3. CTO Report (Maria Rodriguez)**

CTO Rodriguez:  The delays in SIT stemmed from unexpected compatibility issues with a third-party API. We've identified the problem and implemented a workaround. We're also implementing stricter compatibility testing protocols going forward.

**4. CFO Financial Impact (Emily Carter)**

CFO Carter:  The SIT delays will impact our Q4 budget by approximately $50,000, largely due to extended consultant fees.  However, the overall financial impact is manageable and within our projected risk tolerance.

**5. COO Operational Impact (Raj Patel)**

COO Patel:  From an operational standpoint, the delays haven't impacted our training schedules, but we need to ensure our marketing materials reflect the updated launch date.

**6. Discussion and Questions**

* **Independent Director Smith:**  Maria, can you assure us these compatibility issues won't resurface in future releases?
* CTO Rodriguez:  We believe the workaround and new testing protocol effectively mitigate this risk.  We'll present a more detailed risk assessment at the next meeting.
* **Lead Investor Anna Lee:** I'm concerned about the budget overruns. Can we review the contingency plans in more detail?
* CFO Carter:  We've already factored in a contingency for such situations. The $50,000 overrun remains within that buffer.
* **Risk/Audit Committee Chair Brown:** I concur with Anna. A more thorough review of the contingency plan related to unforeseen technical issues would be beneficial.


**7. Decisions and Action Items**

* **Agreed:** The updated Q4 launch date, reflecting the SIT delays, will be communicated to relevant stakeholders.
* **Action Item (Maria Rodriguez):**  Present a detailed risk assessment report addressing API compatibility issues at the next board meeting.
* **Action Item (Emily Carter):**  Provide a detailed breakdown of the Q4 budget, including the contingency plan, at the next board meeting.
* **Action Item (Raj Patel):**  Finalize and approve marketing materials reflecting the updated launch date.

**8. Adjournment (Sarah Miller)**

Chair Miller: Thank you all for your contributions.  The meeting is adjourned.
