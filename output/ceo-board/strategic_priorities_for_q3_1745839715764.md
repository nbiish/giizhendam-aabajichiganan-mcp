**Amelia Hernandez:**  Good morning, everyone.  Let's focus on our strategic priorities for Q3. David, can you lead us through the proposed initiatives?

**2. CEO Presentation (David Chen)**

**David Chen:**  Thank you, Amelia. Our Q3 priorities are threefold:  (1) Launch of Product X, (2) Expansion into the European market, and (3) Enhancement of our cybersecurity infrastructure.  Detailed reports are in your packets.


**3. Discussion & Questions**

**Sarah Lee (CFO):**  David, the projected ROI for the European expansion is slightly below our target.  Can we discuss mitigating that risk?

**David Chen:**  We believe the long-term potential outweighs the short-term risk, Sarah.  Rajesh, can you speak to the projected cost savings from the cybersecurity improvements?

**Rajesh Sharma (CTO):**  Yes, the updated infrastructure should significantly reduce vulnerability-related expenses, by approximately 15% within the year.

**Emily Carter (Independent Director):**  I'd like clarification on the timeline for Product X launch.  Are there any potential bottlenecks?

**Michael Davis (COO):**  We're on track, but supply chain issues could impact the rollout slightly. We have contingency plans in place.

**Robert Jones (Lead Investor):** I'm supportive of the European expansion.  It aligns with our growth strategy. However, I want to see a detailed contingency plan to address the lower ROI projection in the short-term.

**Susan Williams (Risk/Audit Committee Chair):**  I concur with Robert.  Detailed risk assessments for each initiative need to be presented to the audit committee before final approval.

**4. Clarification and Agreement**

**David Chen:**  We can provide more detailed risk mitigation strategies for the European expansion and Product X launch.  Rajesh, please provide an updated cybersecurity cost-benefit analysis for the audit committee.
